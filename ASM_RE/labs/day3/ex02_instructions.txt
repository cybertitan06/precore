A binary is provided to you (ex2) and it prints out a encoded message.

Reverse engineer the binary and answer the questions below!

1. What's the original message that's being encoded?
2. What is the 'encoding' that's happening?

Encoded message: ��������B - possibly 9 characters

Decoded message: BlipFlag!

Functio is taking each index of the message, multiplying the hex value of the index by x02,
and then storing the result back into the index. Product is so high that the resulting ASCII symbol
cant be represented on a terminal, resulting in the question mark diamonds

  outMsg[0] = 0x42; B
  outMsg[3] = 0x70; p
  outMsg[1] = 0x6c; l
  outMsg[6] = 0x61; a
  outMsg[4] = 0x46; F
  outMsg[7] = 0x67; g
  outMsg[8] = 0x21; !
  outMsg[2] = 0x69; i
  outMsg[5] = 0x6c; l
