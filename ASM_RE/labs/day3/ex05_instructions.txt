A binary is provided to you (ex5) and it prints out a encoded message.

Reverse engineer the binary and answer the questions below!

1. What happens to the password provided to the program?
2. What is being compared inside the program to unlock it?
3. Decode the password inside the program.
4. The program has a decoding algorithm. Take that algorithm and reproduce it in python or C. Decode the string "\x51\x25\x31\x06\x19\x22\x1b\x70\x16\x23\x2e\x70\x23\x22\x70\x1f\x23\x24\x0a\x19\x22\x1b\x70\x19\x0c\x71\x90"
