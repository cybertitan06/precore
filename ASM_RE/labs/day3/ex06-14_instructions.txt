Binaries 6-14 are all structured in the same fashion.

Your goal is to figure out the password and unlock the program.

Each exercise is progressively more difficult and abstract. Your
        instructor can provide the sourcecode for each application 
        after a period of time to help assist you in your reverse
        engineering progress.

Hint: Not all binaries have ONLY 1 solution. Sometimes, you just
        need to build the right string to solve the math.

Hint: Not all passwords are funny sounding strings. Don't get too
        trained to look for solid strings or funny phrases.
