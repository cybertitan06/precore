/**
 * Time to make a game!
 * You will create a C program number guessing game.
 * The behavior should be similar to the sequence below.
 *      1. Generate a random number between X and Y
 *      2. Ask the user to guess the number
 *      3. Reply with something similar to the following answers depending on the guess and comparison.
 *          1. Too High!
 *          2. Too Low!
 *          3. Got it!
 * It's up to you if you want to look ahead and create loops or if you want to just rerun the application every time. 
 * As a push goal if you use a loop, try to implement a # of guesses system which causes the user to lose after a 
 * certain number.
 * @file ex35.c
