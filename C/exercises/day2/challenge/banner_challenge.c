 * Without using a static array, allocate some memory and create a banner to print to the screen.
 * It's up to you on the size, however try to remain within the standard 80x20 console chracter dimensions.
 * The banner should be animated and the text should scroll across the screen similar to how marquee text does in HTML.
 * After creating the banner, dump it to the screen, clean up, then exit out with style.
 * Try to perform proper error and bounds checking to get us to a secure coding standard.
