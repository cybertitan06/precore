## Course Description

This course covers the fundamental concepts of C programming and reaches into advanced concepts related to CNO. The bulk of the course revolves around learning C98/C99 and a practical portion that invloves the implementation of an agent program.

## Prerequisites 

Basic computer science principles and previous programming experience.

## Objectives

- Understanding of the C language
- Understanding of module programming
- Understanding of serialization
- Basic understanding of compiling 
- Basic debugging 
- Networking fundamentals

## Training Hours

Class will be scheduled from 0800-1630 everyday. There will be a 30 min lunch break scheduled from 1200-1230. Expect to be in class for the full duration everday. If you have conflicts or need to leave early please notify the class instructor and chain of command as soon as possible.
