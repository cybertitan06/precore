# Python Intro Exercises

These exercises shouldn't be tough, but are generated to bring you up to speed on the Python syntax and get you familiar with different concepts of the language. Commit you're updated copy of this document with your answers to and any Python files you generated for exercises #tasks.

## Basics.py

1. Assign an integer value to the variable bottles and print it
```

```
2. Multipart.
```
```
2.1 Write some code to determine the number of seconds in an hour. 
```

```
2.2 Assign that value to a variable. 
```

```
2.3 Using that variable, determine how many seconds are in a day.
```

```
2.4 Save the result from 2.3 to a variable. 
```

```
2.5 Divide the number of seconds in a day by the number of seconds per hour using both floating point and integer division. Check to see if they are the same. 
```

```

3. Multipart.
```
```
3.1 Assign a number between 1 and 10 to a variable secret. 
```
```
3.2 Assign another number between 1 and to to a variable guess. 
```

```
3.3 Write conditional code to print "too high", "too low", and "correct" depending on whether guess is higher, lower, or equal to secret. 
```

```

4. Assign True/False to `small` and `green`. Write an if/else to print which of those match "cherry", "pea", "watermelon", or "pumpkin".
```

```
5. Capitalize the word starting with `c`. ```phrase  = "The farmer said:\n How now brown cow.\n Where are you going?"```
```

```

6. Print the following with in the form Q: question\n A: answer
```
questions = [
    "We don't serve strings around here. Are you a string?",
    "What is said on Father's Day in the forest?",
    "What makes the sound 'Sis! Boom! Bah!'?"
]
answers = [
    "An exploding sheep.",
    "No, I'm a frayed knot.",
    "'Pop!' goes the weasel."
]
```  

```

    
```  
7. Write the following using old style formatting. Substitute in "know", "though", "here", "snow".
```

```
8. Multipart.
```
```
8.1 Save the following as letter
```
Dear {salutation} {name},

Thank you for your letter. We are sorry that our {product}
{verbed} in your {room}. Please note that it should never
be used in a {room}, especially near any {animals}.

Send us your receipt and {amount} for shipping and handling.
We will send you another {product} that, in our tests,
is {percent}% less likely to have {verbed}.

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,
{spokesman}
{job_title}
```  
``` 

``` 
8.2 Assign the letter the values of your choosing using `.format()`.  
```

```
8.3 Assign the letter the values of your choosing using f strings.  
```

```
9. Use a for loop to print the values of the list [3, 2, 1, 0].  
```

```
10. Use your code from 2, a `while` loop, and `input()` the have the user guess the secret number. 
```

```
11. Get a number from a user, use a binary search algorithm to determine what the number is in the fewest number of steps. The program should pring iteration of the search, and whether the current number was too high, low, or if it found the number.
```


```
12. Get a password from the user (or use a sample string) and determine whether it is secure. It should contain at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number, and 1 special character. It should be at least 14 characters long, and have no more than 3 repeat elements (aka no 4 letters in a row, 4 numbers in a row, etc...)
```


```
13. Decode the following base64 encoded message using Python dGhlIGNha2UgaXMgYSBsaWU=
```

```

14 XOR Decryptor

14.1. Decrypt the XOR encoded file named file1.txt . The key is A. An example script is provided that can read the file and print out the contents
```


```
14.2. Decrypt the XOR encoded file named file2.txt . The key is B.
```


```
14.3. Decrypt the XOR encoded file named file3.txt. It is a single byte key.
```

```
14.4. Decrypt the XOR encoded file named file4.txt. It is a two byte key.
```

```
15. Write an Http Request Parser
```

```


16. Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

```
```
